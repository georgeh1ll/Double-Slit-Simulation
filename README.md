# Double-Slit-Simulation

Simulator for the Young Double Slit Experiment in Python. 

The double-slit experiment is a fundamental experiment that provides evidence for the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. It demonstrates that light and matter can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. The experiment was originally conducted by Thomas Young in 1801.

The main variables in the experiment are: wavelength of light, slit seperation, screen distance and slid width. These can all be changed within this simulation.
